# Heart-Attack-prediction-
In this project we are going to predict the chances of heart attack on the basis of the patient's medical report.We are going to use various machine learning algorithm to train our dataset and we will do a test run on our model to depict the most accurate model so that we predict accurate results.

## About this dataset 
- Age : Age of the patient  
- Sex : Sex of the patient  
- exang: exercise induced angina (1 = yes; 0 = no)  
- ca: number of major vessels (0-3)  
- cp : Chest Pain type chest pain type  Value 1: typical angina Value 2: atypical angina Value 3: non-anginal pain Value 4: asymptomatic 
- trtbps : resting blood pressure (in mm Hg)  c
- hol : cholestoral in mg/dl fetched via BMI sensor  
- fbs : (fasting blood sugar > 120 mg/dl) (1 = true; 0 = false)  
- rest_ecg : resting electrocardiographic results  Value 0: normal Value 1: having ST-T wave abnormality (T wave inversions and/or ST elevation or depression of > 0.05 mV) Value 2: showing probable or definite left ventricular hypertrophy by Estes' criteria thalach : maximum heart rate achieved  
- target : 0= less chance of heart attack 1= more chance of heart attack
